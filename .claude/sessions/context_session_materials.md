# Materials Feature Analysis Session

## Initial Request
User wants to create a materials feature similar to the existing clients module with:
- Table columns: name, id, description, price, unit, category
- Need recommendations for shadcn/ui components for form fields
- Category selector/dropdown implementation
- UI improvements for materials table
- Form validation best practices

## Current Status
- Analysis completed - existing clients module structure reviewed
- Available shadcn/ui components examined
- Implementation plan created and documented
- Ready for execution phase

## Key Findings

### Existing Components Pattern
- Clients module uses Input, Dialog, Form, Table, Tooltip components
- TanStack Table with filtering, sorting, pagination
- React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Context-based state management

### Required New Components
1. **Select component** - for category and unit dropdowns
2. **Textarea component** - for material descriptions

### Implementation Plan Created
- Detailed component recommendations at `.claude/doc/materials/shadcn_ui.md`
- Comprehensive architecture recommendations at `.claude/doc/materials/nextjs_architecture.md`
- Database schema design with proper types and constraints
- Form validation patterns with predefined categories and units
- UI enhancement suggestions
- File structure recommendations
- Server action patterns following established conventions
- Hook architecture with proper caching and error handling

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

### Database Schema
- Materials table with fields: id (serial), name (varchar), description (text), price (numeric), unit (varchar), category (varchar)
- Timestamp fields for tracking created/updated times
- Proper data types for pricing (NUMERIC(10,2))

### Validation Strategy
- Zod schema validation with comprehensive error messages
- Predefined categories and units for better UX
- Price validation with decimal place restrictions
- Server and client-side validation

### Hook Architecture
- useMaterials: Main data fetching with pagination
- useMaterialsSearch: Enhanced search with category filtering
- useMaterialMutations: CRUD operations with proper cache invalidation
- useMaterialsContext: Modal state management

### Performance Considerations
- React Query caching with appropriate stale times
- Pagination to prevent large dataset loading
- Database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Query deduplication

## Next Steps
- shadcn-ui-architect: For UI component recommendations (Select, Textarea components)
- ui-ux-analyzer: For table UI improvements and enhanced filtering
